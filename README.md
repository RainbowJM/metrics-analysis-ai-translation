# Improving AI Translation Tools  

#### **Project Overview**  
This repository contains files related to the evaluation of AI translation tools, focusing on their **accuracy, cultural sensitivity, and usability** when translating Dutch official documents into English. The project includes a survey analysis, BERTScore evaluations, and human assessment of AI-generated translations from tools like **DeepL, Google Translate, and ChatGPT**.  

#### **Files in This Repository**  

- **LICENSE** – Standard license file for this project.  
- **README.md** – This document, providing an overview of the repository and its contents.
